# festival_picker
A Script to help you sort out which festival provide you the most value for your bucks

## What should it do?

With an given Input Data (Name of festival, acts, genre, price of tickets) it should rank each festival to specific categories, for example most Value, most Acts, best fit for your Taste, etc.

**Maybe:** Make it a Docker Container to Selfhost ...

## How?

  - Database with Data for all festivals
  - Maybe a webscraper to fill in the Data
  - Python script to sort and output
  - GUI?
